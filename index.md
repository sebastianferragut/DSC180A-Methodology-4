## Quarter 2 Brainstorm Prompts

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
_The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter has been the use of agentic AI as a method of data collection. I had never considered using agentic AI in the generation step, only in analysis. This provides a path for novel ways to collect data in a generalized manner. Especially in the current moment where agentic AI is used for a broad swath of tasks, I appreciate its directed use toward data science. I also like that we are using it to improve user's understanding of privacy and data settings/collection across a variety of platforms. As data breaches, leaks, and generally unethical practices occur, improving knowledge of how we can take control in applications we use seems a noble task._

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
_A potential investigation I'd like to pursue for the Quarter 2 Project would be an extension of what we have done so far in Quarter 1 with agentic AI and privacy data mapping in applications. I was also initially under the impression that we would be investigating misinformation with the use of agentic AI, so that is another path I would potentially like to explore. As generative AI itself is the culprit for misinformation, it would be amazing to turn that on its head and use this technology for good and dispel misinformation, especially in official news sources._

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
_A potential change I would make to the approach we have taken so far is to consolidate our efforts under an ensemble of agentic AI. We currently have planned 4 agents that would work in tandem to collect data and provide summaries or analysis of that data. I think we could potentially reshape expectations and redefine which agents we work on for feasability. I would also like to gear our project more toward creating some visualizations over text analysis._

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
_Other techniques I am interested in using in my project include but are not limited to: more NLP methods such as topic modeling for interpretation of data, an interactive dashboard with visualization through D3 or plotly, etc, and evaluation of our agents to ensure validity._
